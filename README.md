# Rusted Fortress
Dwarf Fortress-esque game made in Bevy. Currently WIP, but you can see the current build at https://www.allanwei.com/Rusted-Fortress/.

Controls:
WASD to move the camera around.
Z and X to change the current layer. Similar to dwarf fortress, but the map will render all tiles below the current layer, without a cutoff.
